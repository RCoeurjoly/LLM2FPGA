* Deliverable 2d: FPGA integration + bitstream generation

Definition:
- 2d) FPGA integration + bring-up

Scope:
- This step adds the Nix target to generate a place-and-route artifact for the
  Kintex-7 480T flow via openXC7.
- It does not yet provide a finished production-ready board pinout for YPCB-00338;
  instead it uses a deterministic internal wrapper and targets a valid 7-series
  part for early bitstream output generation.

Procedure:
- Ensure the flake input includes `openXC7`.
- The new derivation is built with `nix build .#matmul-bitstream`.
- The flow creates:
  - a minimal wrapper top (`matmul-bitstream-top.sv`)
  - a synth JSON for nextpnr (`matmul-bitstream.json`)
  - FASM (`matmul-bitstream-fasm`)
  - bitstream (`matmul-bitstream`) output

Notes:
- Target family configured in `flake.nix` is `kintex7` and default part
  `xc7k480tffg1156-1`.
- This is intended as the deliverable 2d bootstrap for PnR/bitstream artifacts.
  The full board-level integration and bring-up steps (constraints, clocks,
  I/O protocol validation, etc.) remain a follow-up before board loading.
