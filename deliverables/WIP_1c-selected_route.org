PyTorch + Torch-MLIR + CIRCT route is the most promising.

It has appeared in two papers: HLSfromPyTorch to System Verilog with MLIR and CIRCT and StreamTensor.

In StreamTensor the whole pipeline from LLM in pytorch to FPGA is demostrated. Unfortunately the git reepo was made private recently, so no access to the source code.

Torch-MLIR and CIRCT are
