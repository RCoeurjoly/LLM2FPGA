LLM2FPGA aims to enable local inference of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) on FPGAs using a fully open-source toolchain. While LLM inference has been demonstrated on proprietary hardware and software, we are not aware of any widely recognized project running open-source LLMs on FPGAs through a fully open-source EDA (Electronics Design Automation) flow. To fill this gap, the project will produce an HDL implementation of a lightweight open-source LLM, verify it via simulation, and then attempt synthesis and place-and-route on freely supported FPGA devices. By providing a fully open alternative to proprietary and cloud-based LLM inference, LLM2FPGA will offer a transparent, flexible, and privacy-friendly way to run your own LLM on local hardware.

State of the art review. Although some candidate projects have been identified, to have the big picture of what has been achieved so far, we need to understand 10 to 15 papers/projects, and what can be reused, even finding synergies between papers/projects.



We are lucky that the keywords LLM and FPGA usually give highly relevant results.



The first subtask is desk research. Survey table of 10+ FPGA-LLM papers/repos, answering the following questions:



Openness: Is the code or detailed design public or promised? Open to open-source FPGA tools? Uses open LLMs?



Hardware: Avoid if it needs extra hardware. Check FPGA and open toolchain support.



Design: Note method (RTL/HLS), model size (<10M preferred), proof-of-concept potential, and proprietary tool dependencies.



Second subtask:



The purpose is to identify issues or blockages, not to get each project completely reproduced.



— Can the HDL (SystemVerilog, Verilog) be parsed by Yosys or yosys-slang?



— If HLS is used, can the original C/C++ code be compiled with Vericert or another FOSS HLS tool?



Issues or blockages such as:



— Uses features of HDL (SystemVerilog, VHDL) that are not supported in yosys.



In yosys, Verilog support is more mature than SystemVerilog (with yosys-slang) or VHDL (with ghdl-yosys-plugin)



— Same for HLS



The third subtask:



— Chosen kernel + why



— Any major blockers found in other candidates



— Fallback plan in case current kernel becomes unviable



From now on, we call the chosen kernel the *selected route*.



- Publish survey results based on desk research.

- Research compatibility of potential projects with open source tooling: create a script that clones each repo and runs elaboration with Yosys; logs archived (green, blockages etc)

- Write up and publish results of the research and next steps. (chosen kernel and why + fallback)

Test if a small open-source language model (TinyStories-1M) can be lowered from PyTorch to synthesizable RTL using a fully open-source compilation flow.

In this task we move from small matmul module to smallest available LLM.
This task establishes existence of a valid lowering path only; scalability and hardware execution are out of scope, for later tasks.

The succesful result is an unintegrated RTL netlist of the model (RTLIL or Verilog/SystemVerilog) and synthesis resource estimates, without stubbing operators.

Otherwise, bottleneck report identifying unsupported operators, failing passes, or any other error in the toolchain.

Functional equivalence to PyTorch is not evaluated in this task; only structural synthesizability is established. Semantic validation is addressed in the subsequent hardware validation task.

Risks:

Unsupported MLIR operations found during lowering.

Invalid, non-synthesizable, or structurally incorrect RTL emitted by CIRCT.

Toolchain pass interactions leading to verifier failures or fatal errors at stage boundaries.

Mitigations:
Use -verify-each for each MLIR stage.

For failures, isolate minimal reproducing cases using mlir-reduce and archive them.

If necessary, adjust pass ordering. Final success must not rely on operator stubbing or blackboxes.

evaluate how resource usage and pipeline robustness change across the published TinyStories model family (1M/3M/8M/28M/33M, excluding 1Layer-21M). https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories

No new model architectures are introduced.

Success would be: a reproducible per-model pipeline results matrix (stage pass/fail, compile time, resource/timing where available) plus a scaling report for the TinyStories family.

Pipeline does not work for larger models.
Mitigation: reduce those cases with mlir-reduce

Compile time or memory usage of the toolchain becomes prohibitive.
Mitigation: record wall-clock time and peak memory usage for each pipeline stage. If a stage fails due to resource exhaustion, get the smallest failing reproducer.

Generate scaling plots of resource usage (LUT/FF/BRAM/DSP), compile time, and (if available) Fmax vs parameter count and selected hyperparameters. Fit simple models (e.g. linear or polynomial in parameter count) and report observed trends.

Note: these trends would apply only to TinyStories, not to other model families.

Some strategy breaks the pipeline.
No resource reduction.
